            <p>
                - As the caravan crests the last hill, you first see the towering Citadel of Deidargil Castle reaching for the sky, high on the cliff face. As more of the city is revealed, the first thing that comes to your minds...is cramped. At the base of the large cliff face, are thousands and thousands of small huts and buildings, all crammed together in Shanty town - a hasty solution of a crippling refugee problem. <br>
                - Crawling up the cliff were clearly defined winding staircases, as well as that there were several large wooden elevators also making the climb. At the top of the ridge, there were several piers stabbing out from the cliff, at the end of where Airships were docked either unloading or loading supplies and passengers.<br>
                - The edge of Shanty Town was outlined by a rough and rather unkept wooden palisade, there were a trio of equally rough gates leading through it guarded each a squad of guards-checking over the day's stream of travellers leaving and entering the city.<br>
                - (players head to the gates and are directed to the Guard Captain in the city proper - can be found in King Hédiart Fort- the players can either choose to pay for the elevator (5C) or take the stairs which is longer.)<br>
                - As you reached the top of the cliff, the rest of the city is revealed to you. You exit in the Nobel's Quarter, and the difference in the buildings this time is obvious, they are clearly organised and well kept and much better built than those below.<br>
                - Deidargil Castle and it's famous Citadel remains the focal point of the skyline, in it's shadow is sat the Astraria Cathedral with it's large doors open welcoming all within it's walls, before which sat the city's main market in a large expanse of multi-coloured stalls and activity.<br>
                - Following the guard's directions you walk past a large domed building in similar size to the Cathedral, in front of which a smaller but no less impressive expanse of stalls sit. In the distance you get your first glimpse of the famous wall that not only protects the city, but also the rest of the continent from the dark forces.<br>
                - To it's side were two lines of smithy's, the banging of anvils and bellowing of bellows echoed easily over the noise that permeated the city.<br>
                - The streets themselves are packed, citizens of all races and sizes walk the streets closely watched by pockets of guards - who wear a miss-match of new and battered armour and wield rusted and freshly forged weapons.<br>
                - You make your way past a small park, littered with flower bushes and trees, in the middle of which a small statue of a crowned knight on a horse sat pride of place. A small gathering of people stand before it, offering flowers and other gifts to the base in either thanks or wishing for good fortune.<br>
                - On your left you make your way past the cities Crypts, where past Kings and Queens had been lain to rest, many of the bodies long since turned to dust- and other that'd had since been burned to avoid an untimely resurrection.<br>
                - On your right, rose Atraeus Hill, named after King Hediart's Demigryph mount, and where the Kingdom's contingent of Demigryph knights barracked. A large group of heavily armoured guards stand before the gates, with polished halberds held tightly.<br>
                - Walking even further past that you finally come across King Hediart's Fort sat atop another hill, a small wall surrounds the summit and you can see the odd patrol move across them. The gates although small, are no less formidable, and another group of guards stand guard, well disciplined and well equipped.<br>
                - One of the group steps forward and holds out and hand, commanding you to stop.</p>
